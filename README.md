## Overview

GitHound hunts down **exposed API keys, secrets, and credentials** across GitHub by pairing GitHub dorks with pattern matching, contextual detection, and commit-history analysis. Input a [GitHub dork](https://githoundexplore.com/github-dorks) into GitHound, and it will scan any files and repos that match your query for secrets. Unlike typical scanners, **GitHound leverages GitHub‚Äôs Code Search API**, which gives you full visibility across *all* public repositories, not just a few targets. More information is available in the [accompanying blog post](https://tillsongalloway.com/finding-sensitive-information-on-github/).

## New in 3.0
Visualize and manage your search results in real-time with the new GitHound Explore dashboard.  Get started now for free at https://githoundexplore.com or by using the `--dashboard` flag. Learn how to use this with a local installation of GitHound or TruffleHog at the [Wiki page](https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/wiki/GitHound-Explore-%E2%80%93%C2%A0UI-for-result-filtering-&-cloud-scans). Keep in mind you can still use GitHound without the dashboard.

We've also started a **GitHub Dorks Database**, where you can browse and search dorks for various API keywords and get ideas for new dorks! Check it out at https://githoundexplore.com/github-dorks.

## Usage

`echo "AKIA" | git-hound` or `git-hound --query "AKIA"`

## Setup

1. Download latest version of GitHound from https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/releases (with wget [url] or from the web browser).
2. Make sure an API key is set in `config.yml`
4. Run `./git-hound` to test (make sure you're in the correct directory!)

**Configuration:**

GitHound primarily uses `config.yml` (located in the current directory or `$HOME/.githound/`) for configuration. See `config.example.yml` for an example.

Alternatively, you can use environment variables, which will override values in `config.yml`:
- `GITHOUND_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Sets the GitHub API access token.
- `GITHOUND_INSERT_KEY`: Sets the GitHoundExplore Insert Key for the `--dashboard` feature.


## API Key Regexes
GitHound utilizes a database of API key regexes maintained by the [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) authors.

## Use cases

### Corporate: Searching for exposed customer API keys

Knowing the pattern for a specific service's API keys enables you to search GitHub for these keys. You can then pipe matches for your custom key regex into your own script to test the API key against the service and to identify the at-risk account.

`echo "api.halcorp.biz" | githound --dig-files --dig-commits --many-results --rules halcorp-api-regexes.txt --results-only | python halapitester.py`

For detecting future API key leaks, GitHub offers [Push Token Scanning](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-token-scanning) to immediately detect API keys as they are posted.

### Bug Bounty Hunters: Searching for leaked employee API tokens

My primary use for GitHound is for finding sensitive information for Bug Bounty programs. For high-profile targets, the `--many-results` hack and `--languages` flag are useful for scraping >100 pages of results.

`echo "\"uberinternal.com\"" | githound --dig-files --dig-commits --many-results --languages common-languages.txt --threads 100`

## How does GitHound find API keys?

https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/blob/master/internal/app/keyword_scan.go
GitHound finds API keys with a combination of exact regexes for common services like Slack and AWS and a context-sensitive generic API regex. This finds long strings that look like API keys surrounded by keywords like "Authorization" and "API-Token". GitHound assumes that these are false positives and then proves their legitimacy with Shannon entropy, dictionary word checks, uniqueness calculations, and encoding detection. GitHound then outputs high certainty positives.
For files that encode secrets, decodes base64 strings and searches the encoded strings for API keys.

Check out this [blog post](https://tillsongalloway.com/finding-sensitive-information-on-github/) for more details on use cases and methodologies.

## Flags
GitHound makes it easy to find exposed API keys on GitHub using pattern matching, targetted querying, and a robust scoring system.

## Development
### Sending flags on VS Code

On launch.json send the needed flags as args
"args": [
"searchKeyword",
"tillsongalloway.com",
"--regex-file",
"regexes.txt"
]

## Building the project

From the main folder: `go build .`

---

## Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image for Git-Hound, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-githound-container .
```

This command builds the Docker image with the tag `my-githound-container`. You can change the tag name to your preference.

#### Running the Container
To run the Git-Hound Docker container, you'll need to provide your `config.yaml` file and any input files (like `subdomains.txt`) via Docker volumes.

#### Mounting `config.yaml`
Place your `config.yaml` file at a known location on your host machine. This file should contain your Git-Hound configuration, including GitHub credentials.

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# config.yaml
github_username: "your_username"
github_password: "your_password"
# Optional: GitHub TOTP seed
# github_totp_seed: "ABCDEF1234567890"
```

#### Mounting Input Files
If you have a file like `subdomains.txt`, place it in a directory on your host machine.

#### Running the Command
Use the following command to run the container with your configuration and input files:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/config.yaml:/root/.githound/config.yaml -v $(pwd)/data:/data my-githound-container --subdomain-file /data/subdomains.txt
```

Replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with the actual path to your `config.yaml` file. The `-v $(pwd)/data:/data` part mounts a directory containing your input files (`subdomains.txt`) into the container.
